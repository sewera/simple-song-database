- list comprehensions
- sorting namedtuple
- regex searching
- **frontend/backend** class splitting
- a very simple approach to internationalization using json files
- **switch/case** implementation using dictionaries
- default argument values in functions
- Google-style documentation

### Useful code examples in C include
